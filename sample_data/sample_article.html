      <h1>Sample Neurocritical Care Article</h1>
      <p>This open educational page summarizes high-yield neuro ICU topics for teaching and board review. The goal is to identify common, high-stakes management decisions without reproducing a full copyrighted chapter.</p>

      <h2>Status Epilepticus</h2>
      <p>Status epilepticus is a common neurocritical emergency because delayed treatment increases neuronal injury, mortality, and mechanical ventilation exposure. First-line therapy should be delivered rapidly, and clinicians should escalate promptly when seizures continue after the initial antiseizure medication.</p>
      <p>A major pitfall is repeating small benzodiazepine doses instead of moving into a structured algorithm. Refractory status epilepticus requires continuous EEG, hemodynamic planning, and rescue therapies when standard escalation fails.</p>

      <h2>Intracranial Pressure Management</h2>
      <p>Intracranial pressure crises are high-stakes because herniation causes irreversible neurologic injury. Management should focus on head positioning, sedation, osmotherapy, and cerebral perfusion pressure targets that fit the bedside examination.</p>
      <p>Avoid prolonged hyperventilation except as a short bridge during acute deterioration. Guideline-style targets and decision points are especially testable for boards and fellowship education.</p>

      <h2>ECMO Neuromonitoring</h2>
      <p>ECMO patients with neurologic injury represent a less common but high-risk population. Advanced neuromonitoring, anticoagulation tradeoffs, and tertiary-center rescue planning push this topic toward the expert tier even when it appears later in a review article.</p>
